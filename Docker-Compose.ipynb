    "Bind mount: This directly links a path from your host system to a path inside the container. It‚Äôs useful when you want the container to use files from your local filesystem ‚Äî for example, mounting source code for live development. The syntax is host_path:container_path. Example:\n",
    "    - ./src:/app/src\n",
    "means the ./src directory from your host machine is mounted to /app/src inside the container.\n",

    "    - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n",
    "means Docker will mount a managed volume named db-data to the PostgreSQL data folder inside the container.\n",
