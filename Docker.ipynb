    "Docker consists of two main parts: the Docker Client and the Docker Daemon. The Docker Client is the command-line tool that you use to interact with Docker. When you type commands like docker run, the Client takes your input and sends these commands to the Docker Daemon. The Daemon is the background service running on your machine that is responsible for actually creating, running, and managing containers. In the output of docker version, you‚Äôll see two sections labeled ‚ÄúClient‚Äù and ‚ÄúServer.‚Äù The ‚ÄúServer‚Äù corresponds to the Docker Daemon. Without the Daemon running, the Client‚Äôs commands can‚Äôt be executed because the Daemon is the engine that does the real work behind the scenes. So, while you interact with the Client, the Daemon is the part that manages and executes containers on your system."

    "An image is like a blueprint. It‚Äôs a read-only package that contains everything needed to run an application‚Äîcode, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A container is a running instance of an image. When you run a Docker image, Docker creates a container, which is a lightweight, isolated environment where your application runs. Containers start from the read-only image but have their own writable layer, allowing changes while running. Each container has its own filesystem, processes, and network interfaces. Containers can be started, stopped, deleted, and recreated easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a development environment, the workflow often looks like this:\n",
    "Start from image_version_one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run it as a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the container (e.g., install packages, change configs).\n",

    "Create a snapshot (called a commit in Docker) of the container‚Äôs current state.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a production environment, the process is usually simpler:\n",
    "Run a final_image as a container without modification, ensuring consistency and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why snapshots matter:\n",
    "Snapshots let you capture the exact state of a container‚Äôs filesystem at any moment. Since the original image is read-only, any changes made in a running container exist only temporarily in the container‚Äôs writable layer. If you stop or delete the container, those changes are lost by default. By creating a snapshot (committing), you save these changes permanently as a new image version, which can be reused, shared, and deployed consistently."
