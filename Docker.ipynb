    "Docker consists of two main parts: the Docker Client and the Docker Daemon. The Docker Client is the command-line tool that you use to interact with Docker. When you type commands like docker run, the Client takes your input and sends these commands to the Docker Daemon. The Daemon is the background service running on your machine that is responsible for actually creating, running, and managing containers. In the output of docker version, you‚Äôll see two sections labeled ‚ÄúClient‚Äù and ‚ÄúServer.‚Äù The ‚ÄúServer‚Äù corresponds to the Docker Daemon. Without the Daemon running, the Client‚Äôs commands can‚Äôt be executed because the Daemon is the engine that does the real work behind the scenes. So, while you interact with the Client, the Daemon is the part that manages and executes containers on your system."

If you stop or delete the container, those changes are lost by default. By creating a snapshot (committing), you save these changes permanently as a new image version, which can be reused, shared, and deployed consistently."
