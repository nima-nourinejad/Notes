    "In the Python backend ecosystem, a typical service is composed of two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HTTP Server (Web Server)\n",
    "Role: Listens for incoming HTTP requests from clients (like browsers or other services), and sends back HTTP responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Uvicorn, Gunicorn, Daphne, Waitress, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function: It’s responsible for the low-level networking, managing connections, and translating raw HTTP traffic to a format your Python application can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acts as: The gateway between the outside world and your Python backend application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python Backend Application\n",
    "Role: Implements the business logic. It processes incoming requests, interacts with databases or other services if needed, and prepares the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frameworks: FastAPI, Django, Flask, Starlette, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function: It’s where your Python code runs — the heart of your backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication Between These Two Modules:\n",
    "Since the HTTP server and the backend application are distinct parts, they communicate through a defined interface (protocol).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main standards for this communication in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface):\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocking/synchronous\n",
    "\n",
    "Older and widely used, especially in traditional frameworks like Django (pre-3.0) and Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface):\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-blocking/asynchronous\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern, supports async programming, websockets, long-lived connections, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "Used by frameworks like FastAPI, newer Django (channels), Starlette\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Two Standards?\n",
    "WSGI was designed in an era before Python had solid async support. It expects apps to process one request at a time synchronously, which can lead to inefficiency in handling multiple simultaneous requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASGI was created to embrace Python’s asynchronous capabilities, enabling handling of concurrent connections efficiently, supporting websockets and long-lived connections, and improving scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical Workflow:\n",
    "HTTP Server receives a request from a client (browser, mobile app, API consumer).\n",
    "\n",
    "It hands off the request to the Python backend app using either WSGI or ASGI protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend app processes the request (possibly asynchronously if ASGI).\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend app returns a response to the HTTP server via the protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTP server sends the HTTP response back to the original client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "Client (Browser, Mobile, etc.)\n",
    "        ↓ HTTP Request\n",
    "HTTP Server (Uvicorn, Gunicorn, etc.)\n",
    "        ↓ (via WSGI or ASGI)\n",
    "Python Backend Application (FastAPI, Django, Flask, etc.)\n",
    "        ↑ Response\n",
    "HTTP Server\n",
    "        ↑ HTTP Response\n",
    "Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Notes:\n",
    "HTTP Server is usually the component you start/run on your machine or container (uvicorn main:app).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python backend app is your code (routes, business logic) imported by the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a backend in Python, you always have these two components interacting, separated for modularity, performance, and scalability reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "WSGI and ASGI — Not a concrete software component or “layer,” but a specification — a set of rules and conventions.\n",
    "They define how a web server and a backend Python application should communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern Python backend development, the client and server communicate using the HTTP protocol, which governs the exchange of requests and responses over the network. Internally, the HTTP server and the asynchronous Python backend application interact through the ASGI protocol (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface). This protocol enables efficient, non-blocking communication within the server environment, allowing the backend application to handle multiple concurrent requests and support real-time features such as WebSockets. We could also call this combination ASGI application and ASGI server"

    "In FastAPI, the position of the argument in the function signature does not matter when it comes to determining whether it comes from the body, query, or path. What truly matters is how the argument is typed and annotated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break that down clearly:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ What actually matters for FastAPI:\n",
    "If the parameter is a Pydantic model → FastAPI assumes it comes from the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the parameter is a primitive type (str, int, float, bool, etc.) and is wrapped with Body(...) → FastAPI knows it comes from the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the parameter is a primitive type without Body(...) → FastAPI assumes it comes from the query (unless it's matched to a path parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the parameter name matches a path parameter in the URL path (e.g. /items/{item_id}) → FastAPI takes it from the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "If wrapped with Depends(...) → it's handled as a dependency injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In FastAPI, route handler functions can indeed receive four main types of arguments, each coming from a different part of the HTTP request. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 1. Request Body Parameters\n",
    "These are used when the client sends structured data (like JSON) in the body of a request (usually POST, PUT, or PATCH). They are typically passed as Pydantic models or sometimes as raw types (like str, int, dict, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "\n",

    "def create_item(item: Item):  # 👈 FastAPI reads from request body\n",
    "    return {\"name\": item.name, \"price\": item.price}\n",
    "FastAPI knows it's from the body because it's a Pydantic model.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "| Situation                          | What FastAPI assumes         |\n",
    "| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n",
    "| `param: PydanticModel`             | Comes from body              |\n",
    "| `param: str/int/float = 123`       | Comes from query             |\n",
    "| `param: str/int/float = Body(...)` | Comes from body (explicitly) |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 2. Path Parameters\n",
    "These are values embedded directly in the URL path, e.g., /items/42. You define them in the route and match them by name in the function signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")\n",

    "    return {\"item_id\": item_id}\n",
    "item_id is parsed from the path as an int.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI uses the name item_id to map it to {item_id} in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 3. Query Parameters (keyword arguments with default values)\n",
    "These come from the query string portion of the URL, like /items/?skip=10&limit=20. If a parameter has a default value, FastAPI assumes it's a query parameter. In FastAPI, if a parameter is a primitive type (e.g., int, str, float, bool) and it is not explicitly marked with Body(...), Path(...), or Depends(...), then FastAPI will treat it as a query parameter — regardless of whether it has a default value or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/items/\")\n",
    "def list_items(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10):  # 👈 Query parameters\n",
    "    return {\"skip\": skip, \"limit\": limit}\n",
    "If you remove the default (e.g., skip: int), FastAPI considers it required and still from the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use Query(...) for more control (like validation, aliasing, etc.)\n",
    "In FastAPI, Query(...) is used to explicitly declare that a parameter should come from the query string, allowing you to add validation rules, metadata (like titles or descriptions), and default values — even though primitive-type parameters are treated as query parameters by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI, Query\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/items/\")\n",
    "def read_items(\n",
    "    q: str = Query(default=None, min_length=3, max_length=50, description=\"Search query\")\n",
    "):\n",
    "    return {\"q\": q}\n",
    "Even though q: str = None would already be interpreted as a query parameter,\n",
    "\n",
    "Query(...) allows you to add constraints, documentation, and make your intent more explicit and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 4. Dependency Injection Parameters\n",
    "These are injected by FastAPI through the powerful dependency system, often used for auth, DB access, settings, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "from fastapi import Depends\n",
    "\n",
    "def common_params(q: str = None):\n",
    "    return {\"q\": q}\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/search/\")\n",
    "def search_items(commons: dict = Depends(common_params)):  # 👈 Dependency injection\n",
    "    return commons\n",
    "Depends(...) tells FastAPI to resolve that argument using the result of another function (or class).\n",
    "\n",
    "This works for reusable logic, security, DB sessions, etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "In SQLAlchemy, even though we follow Python’s familiar class-object structure, the ORM-enhanced objects (created by using @mapper_registry.mapped or inheriting from Base) have additional internal behaviors — one of them being expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is marked as expired when, for example, a session.commit() is called. In this state, accessing any of its attributes will not simply return the value stored in memory. Instead, SQLAlchemy first sends a fresh SELECT query to the database to reload the latest state of the object. This ensures consistency between the object in Python and the underlying data in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this mechanism relies on the presence of an active database session. If the session is already closed when an attribute of an expired object is accessed, SQLAlchemy can’t perform the automatic refresh, and an exception is raised. This is a common issue in frameworks like FastAPI, where the database session is typically closed immediately after the endpoint function returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we return an expired object from a FastAPI route without refreshing it first, we risk triggering this error later — for example, during JSON serialization, where the object's attributes may be accessed after the session is gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this, we explicitly call session.refresh(obj) before returning the object. This forces an immediate reload from the database, ensuring that all attributes (including those assigned by the database, such as auto-generated primary keys) are up-to-date and safely stored in memory. In these cases, refresh() is essential, because the application might have no idea what value the database assigned — and returning the object without refreshing it could lead to missing or incorrect data in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORM objects can be expired, meaning their attributes are no longer stored in memory and will be reloaded from the DB on access — but this requires an active session. In FastAPI, the session is closed right after returning from the route, so accessing attributes of an expired object after return will fail. That’s why we use session.refresh(obj) before returning — to make sure all data (especially DB-assigned values like primary keys) is loaded and ready."
