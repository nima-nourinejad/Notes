    "\n",
    "Define what metadata is\n",
    "Describe what metadata management is\n",
    "Explain the importance of metadata management\n",
    "List popular tools for metadata management\n",
    "What is metadata?\n",
    "Metadata is data that provides information about other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very broad definition. Here we will consider the concept of metadata within the context of databases, data warehousing, business intelligence systems, and all kinds of data repositories and platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll consider the following three main types of metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical metadata\n",
    "Process metadata, and\n",
    "Business metadata\n",
    "Technical metadata\n",
    "Technical metadata is metadata which defines the data structures in data repositories or platforms, primarily from a technical perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, technical metadata in a data warehouse includes assets such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables that record information about the tables stored in a database, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "each table's name\n",
    "the number of columns and rows each table has\n",
    "A data catalog, which is an inventory of tables that contain information, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "the name of each database in the enterprise data warehouse\n",
    "the name of each column present in each database\n",
    "the names of every table that each column is contained in\n",
    "the type of data that each column contains\n",
    "The technical metadata for relational databases is typically stored in specialized tables in the database called the System Catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process metadata\n",
    "Process metadata describes the processes that operate behind business systems such as data warehouses, accounting systems, or customer relationship management tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many important enterprise systems are responsible for collecting and processing data from various sources. Such critical systems need to be monitored for failures and any performance anomalies that arise. Process metadata for such systems includes tracking things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "process start and end times\n",
    "disk usage\n",
    "where data was moved from and to, and\n",
    "how many users access the system at any given time\n",
    "This sort of data is invaluable for troubleshooting and optimizing workflows and ad hoc queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business metadata\n",
    "Users who want to explore and analyze data within and outside the enterprise are typically interested in data discovery. They need to be able to find data which is meaningful and valuable to them and know where that data can be accessed from. These business-minded users are thus interested in business metadata, which is information about the data described in readily interpretable ways, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "how the data is acquired\n",
    "what the data is measuring or describing\n",
    "the connection between the data and other data sources\n",
    "Business metadata also serves as documentation for the entire data warehouse system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing metadata\n",
    "Managing metadata includes developing and administering policies and processes to ensure information can be accessed and integrated from various sources and appropriately shared across the entire enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creation of a reliable, user-friendly data catalog is a primary objective of a metadata management model. The data catalog is a core component of a modern metadata management system, serving as the main asset around which metadata management is administered. It serves as the basis by which companies can inventory and efficiently organize their data systems. A modern metadata management model will include a web-based user interface that enables engineers and business users to easily search for and find information on key attributes such as CustomerName or ProductType. This kind of model is central to any Data Governance initiative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is metadata management important?\n",
    "Good metadata management has many valuable benefits. Having access to a well implemented data catalog greatly enhances data discovery, repeatability, governance, and can also facilitate access to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well managed metadata helps you to understand both the business context associated with the enterprise data and the data lineage, which helps to improve data governance. Data lineage provides information about the origin of the data and how it gets transformed and moved, and thus it facilitates tracing of data errors back to their root cause. Data governance is a data management concept concerning the capability that enables an organization to ensure that high data quality exists throughout the complete lifecycle of the data, and data controls are implemented that support business objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key focus areas of data governance include availability, usability, consistency, data integrity and data security and includes establishing processes to ensure effective data management throughout the enterprise such as accountability for the adverse effects of poor data quality and ensuring that the data which an enterprise has can be used by the entire organization.\n",

    "NoSQL, which stands for “not only SQL,”\n",
    "or sometimes “non SQL” is a non-relational database design that provides flexible schemas\n",
    "for the storage and retrieval of data. NoSQL databases have existed for many years\n",
    "but have only recently become more popular in the era of cloud, big data, and high-volume\n",
    "web and mobile applications. They are chosen today for their attributes\n",
    "around scale, performance,and ease of use. It's important to emphasize that the \"No\"\n",
    "in \"NoSQL\" is an abbreviation for \"not only\" and not the actual word \"No.\" NoSQL databases are built for specific data\n",
    "models and have flexible schemas that allow programmers to create and manage modern applications. They do not use a traditional row/column/table\n",
    "database design with fixed schemas, and typically not use the structured query language (or\n",
    "SQL) to query data, although some may support SQL or SQL-like interfaces. NoSQLallows data to be stored in a schema-less\n",
    "or free-form fashion. Any data, be It structured, semi-structured,\n",
    "or unstructured,can be stored in any record. Based on the model being used for storing\n",
    "data, there are four common types of NoSQL databases: Key-value store, Document-based, Column-based, and graph-based. Key-value store: Data in a key-value database\n",
    "is stored as a collection of key-value pairs. The key represents an attribute of the data\n",
    "and is a unique identifier. Both keys and values can be anything from\n",
    "simple integers or strings to complex JSON documents. Key-value stores are great for storing user\n",
    "session dataanduser preferences, making real-time recommendations and targeted advertising,\n",
    "and in-memory data caching. However, if you want to be able to query the\n",
    "data on specific data value, need relationships between data values, or need to have multiple\n",
    "unique keys, a key-value store may not be the best fit. Redis, Memcached, and DynamoDB are some well-known\n",
    "examples in this category. Document-based: Document databasesstore each\n",
    "record and its associated data within a single document. They enable flexible indexing, powerful ad\n",
    "hoc queries, and analytics over collections of documents. Document databases are preferable for eCommerce\n",
    "platforms, medical records storage, CRM platforms, and analytics platforms. However, if you’re looking to run complex\n",
    "search queries and multi-operation transactions, a document-based database may not be the best\n",
    "option for you. MongoDB, DocumentDB, CouchDB, and Cloudant\n",
    "are some of the popular document-based databases. Column-based: Column-based models store data\n",
    "in cells grouped as columns of data instead of rows. A logical grouping of columns, that is, columns\n",
    "that are usually accessed together, is called a column family. For example, a customer’s name and profile\n",
    "information will most likely be accessed together but not their purchase history. So,customer name and profile information data\n",
    "can be grouped into a column family. Since column databases store all cells corresponding\n",
    "to a column as a continuous disk entry, accessing and searching the data becomes very fast. Column databases can be great for systems\n",
    "that require heavy write requests, storing time-series data, weather data, and IoT data. But if you need to use complex queries or\n",
    "change your querying patterns frequently, this may not be the best option for you. The most popular column databases are Cassandra\n",
    "and HBase. Graph-based: Graph-based databases use a graphical\n",
    "model to represent and store data. They are particularly useful for visualizing,\n",
    "analyzing, and finding connections between different pieces of data. The circles arenodes, and they contain the\n",
    "data. The arrows represent relationships. Graph databases are an excellent choice for\n",
    "working with connected data, which is data that contains lots of interconnected relationships. Graph databases are great for social networks,\n",
    "real-time product recommendations, network diagrams, fraud detection, and access management. But if you want to process high volumes of\n",
    "transactions, it may not be the best choice for you, because graph databases are not optimized\n",
    "for large-volume analytics queries. Neo4J and CosmosDB are some of the more popular\n",
    "graph databases. Advantages of NoSQLNoSQL was created in response\n",
    "to the limitations of traditional relational database technology. The primary advantage of NoSQL is its ability\n",
    "to handle large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Some of its other advantages include: The ability to run as distributed systemsscaled\n",
    "across multiple data centers, which enables them to take advantage of cloud computing\n",
    "infrastructure; An efficient and cost-effective scale-out\n",

    "and improved scalability that enables you to be more agile, more flexible, and to iterate\n",
    "more quickly To summarizethe key differencesbetween relational\n",
    "and non-relational databases: RDBMS schemas rigidly define how all data\n",
    "inserted into the database must be typed and composed, whereas NoSQL databases can be schema-agnostic,\n",
    "allowing unstructured and semi-structured data to be stored and manipulated. Maintaining high-end, commercial relational\n",
    "database management systems is expensive whereas NoSQL databases are specifically designed\n",
    "for low-cost commodity hardware Relational databases, unlike most NoSQL, support\n",
    "ACID-compliance, which ensures reliability of transactions and crash recovery. RDBMS is a mature and well-documented technology,\n",

    "All data mining repositories have a similar\n",
    "goal, which is to house data for reporting, analysis, and deriving insights. But their purpose, types of data stored, and\n",
    "how data is accessed differs. In this video, we will learn about some of\n",
    "the characteristics and applications of data warehouses, data marts, and data lakes. A data warehouse is a central repository of\n",
    "data integrated from multiple sources. Data warehouses serve as the single source\n",
    "of truth—storing current and historical data that has been cleansed, conformed, and\n",
    "categorized. When data gets loaded into the data warehouse,\n",
    "it is already modeled and structured for a specific purpose, meaning it's analysis-ready. Traditionally, data warehouses are known to\n",
    "store relational data from transactional systems and operational databases such as CRM, ERP,\n",
    "HR, and Finance applications. But with the emergence of NoSQL technologies\n",
    "and new data sources, non-relational data repositories are also being used for data\n",
    "warehousing. Typically, a data warehouse has a three-tier\n",
    "architecture: The bottom tier of the architecture includes\n",
    "the database servers, which could be relational, non-relational, or both, that extract data\n",
    "from different sources. The middle tier of the architecture consists\n",
    "of the OLAP Server, a category of software that allows users to process and analyze information\n",
    "coming from multiple database servers. And the topmost tier of the architecture includes\n",
    "the client front-end layer. This tier includes all the tools and applications\n",
    "used for querying, reporting, and analyzing data. In response to the rapid data growth and today's\n",
    "sophisticated analytics tools, data warehouses that once resided in on-premise data centers\n",
    "are moving to the cloud. Compared to their on-premise versions, some\n",
    "of the benefits offered by cloud-based data warehouses include: Lower costs, Limitless storage and compute capabilities, Scale on a pay-as-you-go basis; and Faster disaster recovery. As an organization, you would opt for a data\n",
    "warehouse when you have massive amounts of data from your operational systems that need\n",
    "to be readily available for reporting and analysis. Some of the popularly used data warehouses\n",
    "include Teradata Enterprise Data Warehouse platform, Oracle Exadata, IBM Db2 Warehouse\n",
    "on Cloud, IBM Netezza Performance Server, Amazon RedShift, BigQuery by Google Cloudera's\n",
    "Enterprise Data Hub, and Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse. A data mart is a sub-section of the data warehouse,\n",
    "built specifically for a particular business function, purpose, or community of users. For example, sales or finance groups in an\n",
    "organization accessing data for their quarterly reporting and projections. There are three basic types of data marts—dependent,\n",
    "independent, and hybrid data marts. Dependent data marts are a sub-section of\n",
    "an enterprise data warehouse. Since a dependent data mart offers analytical\n",
    "capabilities for a restricted area of the data warehouse, it also provides isolated\n",
    "security and isolated performance. Independent data marts are created from sources\n",
    "other than an enterprise data warehouse, such as internal operational systems or external\n",
    "data. Hybrid data marts combine inputs from data\n",
    "warehouses, operational systems, and external systems. The difference also lies in how data is extracted\n",
    "from the source systems, the transformations that need to be applied, and how the data\n",
    "is transported into the mart. Dependent data marts, for example, pull data\n",
    "from an enterprise data warehouse, where data has already been cleaned and transformed. Independent data marts need to carry out the\n",
    "transformation process on the source data since it is coming directly from operational\n",
    "systems and external sources. Whatever the type, the purpose of a data mart\n",
    "is to: provide users' data that is most relevant\n",
    "to them when they need it, accelerate business processes by providing\n",
    "efficient response times, provide a cost and time-efficient way in which\n",
    "data-driven decisions can be taken, improve end-user response time; and provide secure access and control. A Data Lake is a data repository that can\n",
    "store large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in their native format. While a data warehouse stores data that has\n",
    "been cleaned, processed, and transformed for a specific need, you do not need to define\n",
    "the structure and schema of data before loading into the data lake. You do not even need to know all of the use\n",
    "cases for which you will ultimately be analyzing the data. A data lake exists as a repository of raw\n",
    "data in its native format, straight from the source, to be transformed based on the use\n",
    "case for which it needs to be analyzed. Which does not mean that a data lake is a\n",

    "So last week, I'm having dinner at this\n",
    "restaurant and I'm looking around, the place is packed,\n",
    "everyone's getting their orders on time. And I couldn't help but\n",
    "think about the logistics that go into a restaurant turning raw\n",
    "ingredients into these delicious meals. So let's think about this for a minute. So, in a commercial kitchen, we have raw ingredients being delivered by trucks to our loading dock on large pallets, right? So truck comes in to the loading dock,\n",
    "they drop off the pallet, and the truck is back out on the road to deliver more\n",
    "ingredients to other restaurants. So that's the easy part. Now we actually have to unwrap\n",
    "this pallet and process it, right? We have to sort everything on it. We have to label all of our ingredients,\n",
    "right? And then we also have to make sure that\n",
    "each item is routed to the correct storage area. So these things could be going\n",
    "into a pantry for dry goods, or it could also be going into\n",
    "large walk in fridges and freezers for\n",
    "things like fresh vegetables and meats. And we also have to organize\n",
    "those storage areas, right? So we've got to make sure that ingredients\n",
    "that are expiring first are used first. We've got to make sure certain ingredients\n",
    "are separated from one another for contamination reasons. And we also have to make sure that\n",
    "certain ingredients hit a very certain temperature also for food safety. And by the way, we need to do all of\n",
    "this as quickly as possible, right? To minimize things like food waste, to minimize spoilage that we\n",
    "could see from the ingredients just sitting on the truck or\n",
    "on a pallet, right? And without this process,\n",
    "the cooks in the kitchen can't really do their job\n",
    "as effectively or safely. They'd be spending a lot of their\n",
    "time just looking for ingredients and less time actually cooking and serving\n",
    "out meals to their customers, right? Okay, so\n",
    "what does this have to do with data? Well, if we think about it,\n",
    "this very same process also exists within data architectures\n",
    "of organizations. So you've got all sorts of different\n",
    "data coming into your organizations from different sources,\n",
    "such as in different cloud environments, different operational applications. Now we even have social media data, right? All this is coming into our\n",
    "organization just like a kitchen has ingredients coming from\n",
    "different suppliers, okay? So constantly have data coming in. We need a quick place to dump all\n",
    "different types of data in different formats for later use. So we have data lakes. Now, these lakes allow us to cheaply and quickly capture raw, structured, and unstructured and\n",
    "even semi structured data. Okay, so now, just like in the kitchen, we're not really cooking\n",
    "on the loading dock, right? Now, maybe I can put a tiny grill\n",
    "there if I really wanted to. But we have to organize and transform this data from its raw state\n",
    "into something that's usable for the kind of insights and analytics\n",
    "that our business wants to generate. So we have enterprise data warehouses or\n",
    "EDWs, right, where data is loaded in,\n",
    "sometimes from a data lake, but sometimes from other sources\n",
    "like operational applications. And it's optimized and organized to run very specific analytical tasks. Now, this could be powering\n",
    "different business intelligence or BI workloads such as building\n",
    "dashboards and reports, or it could be feeding into\n",
    "other analytical tools. Just like our pantries and\n",
    "freezers data in the warehouse is cleaned, organized, governed, and\n",
    "should be trusted for integrity. Okay, so what are some of the challenges\n",
    "that we see in this approach? Well, as we said, data lakes are really awesome to capture\n",
    "tons of data in a cost effective way. But we run into challenges with data governance and data quality, right? And a lot of times these data\n",
    "lakes can become data swamps. And this happens when there's a lot of\n",
    "duplicate, inaccurate, or incomplete data, making it difficult to track and\n",
    "manage assets. So if you think about it,\n",
    "what happens when that data becomes stale? Well, it loses its value in creating\n",
    "insights, the same way that ingredients go bad over time in our restaurant\n",
    "if we don't use them. So data lakes also have challenges\n",
    "with query performance. Since they're not built and optimized to\n",
    "handle the complex analytical queries, it can sometimes be tough to get\n",
    "insights out of lakes directly. Okay, so let's take a look\n",
    "at the data warehouse now. Now, these are really great\n",
    "at query performance. They're exceptional, but\n",
    "they can come at a high cost, right? Just like those big freezers\n",
    "can be very costly to run, we can't put everything\n",
    "into a data warehouse. Now, they can be better optimized\n",
    "to maintain data governance and quality, but they have limited support for semi structured and\n",
    "unstructured data sources. By the way, the ones that are growing the most\n",
    "that are coming into our organization. And they can also sometimes be\n",
    "too slow for certain types of applications that require the freshest\n",
    "data because it takes time to sort, clean, and load data into the warehouse. Okay, so what do we do here? Well, developers took a step back and\n",
    "said, hey, let's take the best of both data lakes and\n",
    "data warehouses and combine them into a new technology\n",
    "called the data lake house. So we get the flexibility and we get the cost effectiveness\n",
    "of a data lake, and we get the performance and structure of a data warehouse. So we'll talk more specifically about\n",
    "the architecture of a data lake house in a future video. But from a value point of view,\n",
    "the lake house lets us store data from the exploding number of new\n",
    "sources in a low cost way, and then leverages built\n",
    "in data management and governance layers to allow us to\n",
    "power both business intelligence and high performance machine\n",
    "learning workloads quickly. Okay, so there are plenty of ways\n",
    "that we can start using a lakehouse. We can modernize our existing data lakes,\n",
    "we can complement our data warehouses to support some of these new types of AI and\n",
    "machine learning driven workloads, but we'll also talk about\n",
    "that in the future video. So the next time you're at a restaurant, I hope you think about how the meal\n",
    "on your plate got there and the steps the ingredients took to go from\n",

    "such as: ETL, or the Extract, Transform, and Load Process ELT, or the Extract, Load, and Transform Process;\n",
    "and Data Pipelines Now we come to the process that is at the\n",
    "heart of gaining value from data. The Extract, Transform, and Load process,\n",
    "or ETL. ETL is how raw data is converted into analysis-ready\n",
    "data. It is an automated process in which you gather\n",
    "raw data from identified sources, extract the information that aligns with your\n",
    "reporting and analysis needs, clean, standardize, and transform that data\n",
    "into a format that is usable in the context of your organization; and load it into a data repository While ETL is a generic process, the actual\n",
    "job can be very different in usage, utility, and complexity. Extract is the step where data from source\n",
    "locations is collected for transformation. Data extraction could be through Batch processing, meaning source data is moved\n",
    "in large chunks from the source to the target system at scheduled intervals. Tools for batch processing include Stitch\n",
    "and Blendo. Stream processing, which means source data\n",
    "is pulled in real-time from the source and transformed while it is in transit and before\n",
    "it is loaded into the data repository. Tools for stream processing include Apache\n",
    "Samza, Apache Storm, and Apache Kafka. Transform involves the execution of rules\n",
    "and functions that convert raw data into data that can be used for analysis. For example, making date formats and units of measurement\n",
    "consistent across all source data removing duplicate data filtering out data that you do not need enriching data, for example, splitting full\n",
    "name to first, middle, and last names establishing key relationships across tables applying business rules and data validations Load is the step where processed data is transported\n",
    "to a destination system or data repository. It could be: Initial loading, that is, populating all the\n",
    "data in the repository; Incremental loading, that is, applying ongoing\n",
    "updates and modifications as needed periodically; or Full refresh, that is, erasing contents of\n",

    "for missing or null values, server performance, and monitoring load failures, are important\n",
    "parts of this process step. It is vital to keep an eye on load failures\n",
    "and ensure the right recovery mechanisms are in place. ETL has historically been used for batch workloads\n",
    "on a large scale. However, with the emergence of streaming ETL\n",
    "tools, they are increasingly being used for real-time streaming event data as well. Some of the popular ETL tools available include\n",
    "IBM Infosphere Information Server, AWS Glue, Improvado, Skyvia, HEVO, and Informatica PowerCenter. Now let’s look at a variation of the ETL\n",
    "process—the Extract, Load, and Transfer, or ELT process. In the ELT process, extracted data is first\n",
    "loaded into the target system, and transformations are applied in the target system. The destination system for an ELT pipeline\n",
    "is most likely a data lake, though it can also be a data warehouse. ELT is a relatively new technology powered\n",
    "by cloud technologies. Why do we need an ELT process? ELT is useful for processing large sets of\n",
    "unstructured and non-relational data. It is ideal for data lakes where transformations\n",
    "on the data are applied once the raw data is loaded into the data lake. The ELT process has several advantages. Since the raw data is delivered directly to\n",
    "the destination system rather than a staging environment, this shortens the cycle between\n",
    "extraction and delivery. ELT paired with a data lake allows you to\n",
    "ingest volumes of raw data as immediately as the data becomes available. Compared to the ETL process, ELT affords greater\n",
    "flexibility to analysts and data scientists for exploratory data analytics. ELT transforms only that data which is required\n",
    "for a particular analysis so it can be leveraged for multiple use cases. In the ETL process, the entire structure of\n",
    "the data in the warehouse may need to be modified if it is not suited for a new use case. ELT is more suited to work with Big Data. It’s common to see the terms ETL or ELT\n",
    "and data pipelines used interchangeably. And although both move data from source to\n",
    "destination, data pipeline is a broader term that encompasses the entire journey of moving\n",
    "data from one system to another, of which ETL and ELT may be subsets. Data pipelines can be architected for batch\n",
    "processing, for streaming data, and a combination of batch and streaming data. In the case of streaming data, data processing\n",
    "or transformation, happens in a continuous flow. This is particularly useful for data that\n",
    "needs constant updating, such as data from a sensor monitoring traffic. A data pipeline is a high performing system\n",
    "that supports both long-running batch queries and smaller interactive queries. The destination for a data pipeline is typically\n",
    "a data lake, although data may also be loaded to different target destinations, such as\n",
    "another application or a visualization tool. There are a number of data pipeline solutions\n",
    "available, most popular among them being Apache Beam, AirFlow, and DataFlow. In this video, we learned about some of the\n",

    "In the big data ecosystem, Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark each play distinct but complementary roles, forming a powerful triad for managing and analyzing massive amounts of data. Hadoop provides the foundational layer for storing data in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner through its HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), and it originally handled processing via MapReduce, though that’s now often replaced with more modern tools like Spark. Kafka, on the other hand, is a high-throughput, distributed messaging system used to stream real-time data between systems — for instance, capturing user actions, application logs, or events from various sources and publishing them in real-time pipelines. Kafka itself doesn’t process or store data long-term, but it’s excellent for reliably transporting data. This is where Apache Spark enters the picture: it acts as the computational engine that can ingest data from both Hadoop (for batch processing) and Kafka (for stream processing), then transform, analyze, and output results — all at scale and often in-memory, which makes it much faster than older MapReduce models. Spark not only handles both batch and real-time data workflows efficiently, but it also supports advanced analytics like SQL queries, machine learning, and graph computation — making it the brain that connects and processes the data Kafka transports and Hadoop stores. Together, these tools provide an end-to-end pipeline: Kafka moves data, Hadoop stores it, and Spark analyzes and transforms it — whether in real-time or in scheduled jobs."

    "data warehouse by consolidating data across the organization and moving “cold” data,\n",
    "that is, data that is not in frequent use, to a Hadoop-based system. One of the four main components of Hadoop\n",
    "is Hadoop Distributed File System, or HDFS, which is a storage system for big data that\n",
    "runs on multiple commodity hardware connected through a network. HDFS provides scalable and reliable big data\n",
    "storage by partitioning files over multiple nodes. It splits large files across multiple computers,\n",
    "allowing parallel access to them. Computations can, therefore, run in parallel\n",
    "on each node where data is stored. It also replicates file blocks on different\n",
    "nodes to prevent data loss, making it fault-tolerant. Let’s understand this through an example. Consider a file that includes phone numbers\n",
    "for everyone in the United States; the numbers for people with last name starting with A\n",
    "might be stored on server 1, B on server 2, and so on. With Hadoop, pieces of this phonebook would\n",
    "be stored across the cluster. To reconstruct the entire phonebook, your\n",
    "program would need the blocks from every server in the cluster. HDFS also replicates these smaller pieces\n",
    "onto two additional servers by default, ensuring availability when a server fails, In addition to higher availability, this offers\n",
    "multiple benefits. It allows the Hadoop cluster to break up work\n",
    "into smaller chunks and run those jobs on all servers in the cluster for better scalability. Finally, you gain the benefit of data locality,\n",
    "which is the process of moving the computation closer to the node on which the data resides. This is critical when working with large data\n",
    "sets because it minimizes network congestion and increases throughput. Some of the other benefits that come from\n",
    "using HDFS include: Fast recovery from hardware failures, because\n",
    "HDFS is built to detect faults and automatically recover. Access to streaming data, because HDFS supports\n",
    "high data throughput rates. Accommodation of large data sets, because\n",
    "HDFS can scale to hundreds of nodes, or computers, in a single cluster. Portability, because HDFS is portable across\n",
    "multiple hardware platforms and compatible with a variety of underlying operating systems. Hive is an open-source data warehouse software\n",
    "for reading, writing, and managing large data set files that are stored directly in either\n",
    "HDFS or other data storage systems such as Apache HBase. Hadoop is intended for long sequential scans\n",
    "and, because Hive is based on Hadoop, queries have very high latency—which means Hive\n",
    "is less appropriate for applications that need very fast response times. Also, Hive is read-based, and therefore not\n",
    "suitable for transaction processing that typically involves a high percentage of write operations. Hive is better suited for data warehousing\n",
    "tasks such as ETL, reporting, and data analysis and includes tools that enable easy access\n",

    "for building a system that is scalable and capable of performing during high workloads. In this video, we will look at some of the\n",
    "primary considerations for designing a data store, such as: The type of data you want to store Volume of data Intended use of data Storage considerations And Privacy, security, and governance needs of\n",
    "your organization. There are multiple types of databases and\n",
    "selecting the right one is a crucial part of designing. A database is essentially a collection of\n",
    "data designed for the input, storage, search and retrieval, and modification of data. Depending on the type of data, databases can\n",
    "be categorized in two primary ways – relational and non-relational. Relational databases, or RDBMSes, are best\n",
    "used for structured data, which has a well-defined schema and can be organized into a tabular\n",
    "format. Non-relational databases, or NoSQL, are best\n",
    "for semi-structured and unstructured data, that is, schema-less and free-form data. Non-relational databases, based on the type\n",
    "of data and how you want to query the data, are of four different types—key-value, document,\n",
    "column, and graph-based. If you're looking to run complex search queries\n",
    "and multi-operation transactions, for example, a document-based database may not be the best\n",
    "option for you. Like you would not opt for a graph-based database\n",
    "if you need to process high-volume transactions because graph-based databases are not optimized\n",
    "for large-volume analytics queries. Another important consideration that goes\n",
    "into the design of a data store is the volume, or scale, of data. When you require to store large volumes of\n",
    "raw data in its native format, straight from its source, a data lake would be the appropriate\n",
    "choice for you. With a data lake, you can store both relational\n",
    "and non-relational data at scale without defining the data's structure and schema. Or when you're dealing with Big Data, that\n",
    "is data that is not only high-volume but also high-velocity, of diverse types, and needs\n",
    "distributed processing for fast analytics, then a big data repository would be an option\n",
    "you would explore. Big data stores split large files across multiple\n",
    "computers allowing parallel access to them. Computations run in parallel on each node\n",
    "where data is stored. How you intend to use the data you are collecting\n",
    "is also an important consideration for the choice and design of a data store. The number of transactions, frequency of updates,\n",
    "type of operations performed on the data, response time, and backup and recovery requirements\n",
    "all need to be provisioned for in the design of a data store. Whether you need to use the data store for\n",
    "recording high-volume transactional data or executing complex queries for analytical purposes,\n",
    "your processing and storage needs will differ. Transactional systems, that is systems used\n",
    "for capturing high-volume transactions, need to be designed for high-speed read, write,\n",
    "and update operations. Analytical systems, on the other hand, need\n",
    "complex queries to be applied to large amounts of historical data aggregated from transactional\n",
    "systems. They need faster response times to complex\n",
    "queries. Schema design, indexing, and partitioning\n",
    "strategies have a big role to play in performance of systems based on how data is getting used. The intended use of data also drives scalability\n",
    "as a design consideration. Scalability of a data store is its capability\n",
    "to handle growth in the amount of data, workloads, and users. Normalization of the database is another important\n",
    "consideration at the design stage. Normalization is the process of efficiently\n",
    "organizing data in a database. Done right, it helps in the optimal use of\n",
    "storage space, makes database maintenance easier, and provides faster access to data. Normalization is important for systems that\n",
    "handle transactional data. But for systems designed for handling analytical\n",
    "queries, normalization can lead to performance issues. Now we'll look at some key design considerations\n",
    "from the perspective of storage. These are Performance, Availability, Integrity,\n",
    "and Recoverability of Data. Performance parameters include throughput\n",
    "and latency. That is, the rate at which information can\n",
    "be read from and written to the storage and the time it takes to access a specific location\n",
    "in storage. Availability - Your storage solution must\n",
    "enable you to access your data when you need it, without exception. There should be no downtime. Integrity - Your data must be safe from corruption,\n",
    "loss, and outside attack. And Recoverability - Your storage solution should\n",
    "ensure that you can recover your data in the event of failures and natural disasters. A secure data strategy is a layered approach. It includes access control, multizone encryption,\n",

    "[Music] enterprise level data platforms and data repositories need to tackle security at multiple levels in this video we will learn about the various facets of security as it applies to data platforms and data life cycle management these include physical infrastructure security network security application security and data security let us first look at the three key components to creating an effective strategy for information security in general these are popularly referred to as the cia triad the c in this triad stands for confidentiality through controlling unauthorized access i for integrity through validating that your resources are trustworthy and have not been tampered with and a is for availability by ensuring authorized users have access to resources when they need it the cia triad is applicable to all facets of security be it infrastructure network application or data security now we'll look at the four different facets or levels of security the first level is physical infrastructure security a key component of security for an it system is the security of the physical infrastructure and facilities that house the system in the case of cloud computing this extends to the cloud service providers infrastructure and facilities here are some of the measures that are taken to ensure physical infrastructure security access to the perimeter of the facility based on authentication and round-the-clock surveillance for entry and exit points multiple power feeds from independent utility providers with dedicated generators and ups battery backup heating and cooling mechanisms for managing the temperature and humidity levels in the facility and by factoring in environmental threats before considering the location of the facility for example infrastructure facilities are never housed in flood plains in areas prone to earthquakes the infrastructure is housed in an earthquake-resistant structure multi-level lightning protection and earthing systems are also installed in such facilities the next level is network security network security is vital to keep interconnected systems and data safe network security solutions include firewalls to prevent unauthorized access to private networks that are connected to the internet network access control to ensure endpoint security by allowing only authorized devices to connect to the network for example a corporate network may not allow devices with outdated service packs to connect to their network network segmentation to create silos or virtual local area networks within a network so that you can segregate your assets into individual silos based on the level of security required for different assets security protocols to ensure attackers cannot tap into data while it is in transit and intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems that inspect incoming traffic for intrusion attempts and vulnerabilities the third dimension of security is application security application security is critical for keeping customer data private and ensuring applications are fast and responsive security needs to be built into the foundation of an application in order to prevent other applications and services from introducing vulnerabilities you can make your application safe by following security engineering practices such as threat modeling to identify relative weaknesses and attack patterns related to the application secure design that mitigates risks secure coding guides and practices that prevent vulnerabilities and security testing to fix problems before the application is deployed and to validate that it is free from known security issues and the fourth and final dimension is data security data is either at rest in storage or in transit between systems applications services and workloads be it at rest or in motion data needs to be protected one of the primary controls for data security is to enable access to data through a system of authentication and authorization authentication systems verify that you are who you say you are and they accomplish this using passwords tokens biometrics or a combination of these authorization ensures that users access information based on their roles and the privileges assigned to their roles data at rest includes files objects and storage this type of data is stored physically such as in a database data warehouse tapes off-site backups or on mobile devices organizations can use encryption to fight threats to their data at rest encrypting data protects information from disclosure even if that information is lost or intercepted data that is moving from one place to another such as when it is transmitted over the internet is referred to as data in transit or data in motion encryption methods such as https ssl and tls are often used to protect data in motion later on in the course you will learn more about the different stages of data life cycle the vulnerabilities data can be exposed to and the security features that help protect data end to end through its life cycle it is vital to proactively monitor track and react to security violations in time and for that you need end-to-end visibility and integration of security processes and tools throughout the enterprise security monitoring and intelligence systems create a complete audit history for triage and compliance purposes and provide reports and alerts that help enterprises react to security violations in time in this video you learned about some of the facets of security as it applies to the enterprise level every enterprise needs to have a corporate level security policy that ensures business i.t and all stakeholders contribute to achieving security goals through people policy processes systems and tools

    "Raw data has to undergo a series of transformations\n",
    "and cleansing activities in order to be analytics-ready. Data wrangling, also known as data munging,\n",
    "is an iterative process that involves data exploration, transformation, validation, and\n",
    "making data available for a credible and meaningful analysis. It includes a whole range of transformations\n",
    "and cleansing activities, some of which we will learn about in this video. Now let’s look at some of key transformations\n",
    "that data typically undergoes in a data analytics scenario. Let’s begin with the first transformation\n",
    "task –(1) Structuring. This task includes actions that change the\n",
    "form and schema of your data. The incoming data can be in varied formats. You might, for example, have some data coming\n",
    "from a relational database and some data from Web APIs. In order to merge them, you will need to change\n",
    "the form or schema of your data. This change may be as simple as (1-1)changing the\n",
    "order of fields within a record or dataset or as complex as (1-2)combining fields into complex\n",
    "structures. (1-2-1)Joins and (1-2-2)Unions are the most common structural\n",
    "transformations used to combine data from one or more tables. How they combine the data is different. Joins combine columns. When two tables are joined together, columns\n",
    "from the first source table are combined with columns from the second source table—in\n",
    "the same row. So, each row in the resultant table contains\n",
    "columns from both tables. Unions combine rows. Rows of data from the first source table are\n",
    "combined with rows of data from the second source table into a single table. Each row in the resultant table is from one\n",
    "source table or another. Transformation can also include (2)normalization\n",
    "and (3)denormalization of data. Normalization focuses on cleaning the database\n",
    "of unused data and reducing redundancy and inconsistency. Data coming from transactional systems, for\n",
    "example, where a number of insert, update, and delete operations are performed on an\n",
    "ongoing basis, are highly normalized. Denormalization is used to combine data from\n",
    "multiple tables into a single table so that it can be queried faster. For example, normalized data coming from transactional\n",
    "systems is typically denormalized before running queries for reporting and analysis. Another transformation type is (4)Cleaning. Cleaning tasks are actions that fix irregularities\n",
    "in data in order to produce a credible and accurate analysis. The first step in the data cleaning workflow\n",
    "is to (4-1)detect the different types of issues and errors that your dataset may have. You can use (4-1-1)scripts and tools that allow you\n",
    "to define specific rules and constraints and validate your data against these rules and\n",
    "constraints. You can also use (4-1-2)data profiling and (4-1-3)data visualization\n",
    "tools for inspection. Data profiling helps you to inspect the source\n",
    "data to understand the structure, content, and interrelationships in your data. It uncovers anomalies and data quality issues. For example, blank or null values, duplicate\n",
    "data, or whether the value of a field falls within the expected range. Visualizing the data using statistical methods\n",
    "can help you to spot outliers. For example, plotting the average income in\n",
    "a demographic dataset can help you spot outliers. That brings us to (4-2)the actual cleaning of the\n",
    "data. The techniques you apply for cleaning your\n",
    "dataset will depend on your use case and the type of issues you encounter. Let’s look at some of the more common data\n",
    "issues. Let’s start with (problem1)missing values. Missing values are very important to deal\n",
    "with as they can cause unexpected or biased results. You can choose to (problem1-solution1)filter out the records with\n",
    "missing values or (problem1-solution2)find a way to source that information in case it is intrinsic to your\n",
    "use case. For example, missing age data from a demographics\n",
    "study. A third option is a method known as (problem1-solution3)imputation,\n",
    "which calculates the missing value based on statistical values. Your decision on the course of action you\n",
    "choose needs to be anchored in what’s best for your use case. You may also come across (problem2) duplicate data, data\n",
    "points that are repeated in your dataset. These need to (problem2-solution)be removed. Another type of issue you may encounter is\n",
    "that of irrelevant data. Data that does not fit within the context\n",
    "of your use case can be considered (problem3)irrelevant data. For example, if you are analyzing data about\n",
    "the general health of a segment of the population, their contact numbers may not be relevant\n",
    "for you. Cleaning can involve (problem4) data type conversion\n",
    "as well. This is needed to ensure that values in a\n",
    "field are stored as the data type of that field—for example, numbers stored as numerical\n",
    "data type or date stored as a date data type. You may also need to clean your data in order\n",
    "to (problem5)standardize it. For example, for strings, you may want all\n",
    "values to be in (problem5-example1)lower case. Similarly, (problem5-example2)date formats and units of measurement\n",
    "need to be standardized. Then there are (problem5-example3)syntax errors. For example, white spaces, or extra spaces\n",
    "at the beginning or end of a string is a syntax error that needs to be rectified. This can also include fixing typos or format,\n",
    "for example, the state name being entered as a full form such as New York versus an\n",
    "abbreviated form such as NY in some records. Data can also have outliers, or values that\n",
    "are vastly different from other observations in the dataset. (problem6)Outliers (problem6-1)may, or (problem6-2)may not, be incorrect. For example, when an age field in a voters\n",
    "database has the value 5, you know it is incorrect data and needs to be corrected. Now let’s consider a group of people where\n",
    "the annual income is in the range of one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand dollars—except\n",
    "for that one person who earns a million dollars a year. While this data point is not incorrect, it\n",
    "is an outlier, and needs to be looked at. In this video, you learned about some of the\n",
    "transformations and cleansing activities that need to be performed on raw data in order\n",
    "to make it analytics-ready. You also learned how data profiling and data\n",

    "data set, identifying extreme values, slicing data, sorting data, filtering patterns, and\n",
    "grouping data. References to specific functions and operators,\n",
    "in this video, map to SQL, which we all know is a query language for RDBMSes. However, the querying techniques are applicable\n",
    "to other query languages as well. NoSQL databases, for example, have their own\n",
    "SQL-like query languages, such as Cassandra CQL and Cypher for Neo4J. Also APIs, that can be used to query data. Something very basic that you do when you\n",
    "start with a data set for analysis is to take stock of how much data you have. In SQL, for example, you can use the COUNT()\n",
    "function to count the number of rows, or records, you have in your data set. The sample data set that you now see on your\n",
    "screen, includes data for customers who have purchased used cars. In this data set there are a total number\n",
    "of fifteen records. And if you want to see how many unique car\n",
    "dealers there are in the data set, you can use the DISTINCT() function to isolate the\n",
    "unique car dealers. If you combine COUNT() with DISTINCT(), you\n",
    "get a count of the total number of unique, or distinct, car dealers. Which in our data set is 8. Aggregation functions also help to provide\n",
    "an overview of the data set from different perspectives. Such as, using the SUM() function to calculate\n",
    "the sum of a numeric column in a table. Using the AVG() function to calculate the\n",
    "average value of a numeric column. And using the STDDEV() function to measure\n",
    "how spread out the numbers are in a data set. In our data set, for example, we can use the\n",
    "STDDEV() function to see how spread out the cost of a used car is. The average cost for a used car is a little\n",
    "less than six thousand dollars. But if you look at some of the individual\n",
    "rows, you see a significant number of records showing less than two thousand dollars and\n",
    "just two records with twenty-five thousand dollars and above. And the standard deviation is over eleven\n",
    "thousand. The greater the standard deviation value,\n",
    "the wider the spread. So, as you can see from this example, looking\n",
    "at the standard deviation brings a different perspective to the data set. The next type of analysis is to identify extreme\n",
    "values in a data column. Such as, the MAX() function, which gives you\n",
    "the maximum value in a column. For example, the highest amount spent by a\n",
    "customer in our data set is thirty-seven dollars. And the MIN() function, which gives you the\n",
    "minimum value in a column. Which, in our data set, is a thousand dollars. Now, let’s say you want to find customers\n",
    "based on a specific condition, or set of conditions. Slicing a data set lets you do that. In this data set, for example, you would use\n",
    "the SLICE() function if you want to retrieve data for customers who live in a certain area\n",
    "or have purchased their car from dealers in a specific area or those who spent between\n",
    "one thousand and two thousand dollars for their car. You can also use operators that allow you\n",
    "to specify multiple values—for example, customers who spent between one thousand and\n",
    "two thousand dollars on their car and live in a specific area. This brings us to sorting data, which helps\n",
    "to arrange data in a meaningful order, making it easier to understand and analyze. For example, if you want to see if car sales\n",
    "go up around festival time, you can sort the data set on the date of purchase to see if\n",
    "a large number of sales transactions took place around that time. And you can do this using the ORDER BY() function. The ORDER BY() function also allows you to\n",
    "sort a data column in ascending or descending order. Another powerful querying technique is filtering\n",
    "patterns, which allows us to perform partial matches of data values. Unlike an EQUAL TO operator, that returns\n",
    "records in which a data value matches a certain value, the LIKE operator helps you to specify\n",
    "a pattern to return records that match a data value partially. In our data set, for example, let’s say\n",
    "we want to filter data for all purchases that happened in a region. The first three digits in the pincodes within\n",
    "this region are constant, but the remaining two digits vary for each area within that\n",
    "region. In this case, we can use the LIKE() operator\n",
    "to specify the pattern we know we are looking for, which in this case is the first three\n",
    "digits. And use wildcard characters for the fourth\n",
    "and fifth digits in the pincode, since these will be different for each area. Which brings us to another important tool\n",
    "for analysis—grouping data. Grouping of data is performed using the GROUP\n",
    "BY statement. For example, you want to find out the total\n",
    "amount spent by customers, pincode-wise. We can use SUM() and GROUP BY to find out\n",
    "the total amount spent by customers grouped by their pincode. In this video, you learned about some of the\n",

    "behavior is actually an issue. The issue could have been reported through\n",
    "an alerting system, by a user, or flagged during a maintenance check. The next step could be to check if you're\n",
    "working with all the right versions of software and source codes. And in case of any recent deployments, you\n",
    "could check what has changed and investigate if there could be a connection. You would also check the logs and metrics\n",
    "early on in your troubleshooting process to isolate whether an issue is related to infrastructure,\n",
    "data, software, or a combination of these. Error messages in logs and the network load,\n",
    "memory and CPU utilization at the time of the failure can help with this. But if the logs don't help you isolate the\n",
    "issue, then you'll possibly need to reproduce the issue in a test environment. This can be an iterative and time-consuming\n",
    "job. Once you have the root cause hypothesis and\n",
    "have validated the hypothesis through a series of tests, you can plan to take it to production\n",
    "as per your team's process. Another essential dimension of performance\n",
    "tuning is optimizing databases for performance. Let's first understand the performance metrics\n",
    "that needs to be monitored in a database. These include: System outages Capacity utilization Application slowdown Performance of queries And Conflicting activities and queries being executed\n",
    "based on multiple users giving requests at the same time, and batch activities causing\n",
    "resource constraints. Let's look at some of the best practices for\n",
    "database optimization such as capacity planning and database design activities such as indexing,\n",
    "partitioning, and normalization. Capacity planning includes the process of\n",
    "determining the optimal hardware and software resources required for performance, even as\n",
    "the load on the system continues to fluctuate on a day-to-day basis. Capacity planning also factors in future growth\n",
    "requirements. Database indexing helps to quickly locate\n",
    "data without searching each row in a database. It minimizes the number of times a disk needs\n",
    "to be accessed when a query is processed. Database partitioning is another feature that\n",
    "provides multiple performance benefits. It's a process whereby very large tables are\n",
    "divided into smaller, individual tables. Queries run faster because they're accessing\n",
    "a smaller part of the data. Partitioning also improves data manageability. Database normalization is a design technique\n",
    "to reduce inconsistencies arising out of data redundancy and anomalies arising out of update,\n",
    "delete, and insert operations on databases. This impacts the efficiency and speed of querying,\n",
    "cleansing, and analyzing operations. Monitoring and alerting systems help us collect\n",
    "quantitative data about our systems and applications in real time. In the data engineering lifecycle, these systems\n",
    "give us visibility into the performance of our data pipelines, platforms, databases,\n",
    "applications, tools, queries, scheduled jobs, and more. Let's look at some of these systems and understand\n",
    "how they work. Database monitoring tools take frequent snapshots\n",
    "of the performance indicators of a database. This can help you track when and how a problem\n",
    "really started to occur. This can help you isolate and get to the root\n",
    "of the issue more efficiently. Application performance management tools help\n",
    "us measure and monitor the performance of applications. They do this by tracking request response\n",
    "time and error messages. These tools also track the amount of resources\n",
    "being utilized by each process, which helps in the proactive allocation of resources to\n",
    "improve application performance. Tools for monitoring the performance of queries\n",
    "gather statistics about query throughput, execution performance, resource utilization\n",
    "and utilization patterns for better planning and allocation of resources. Data pipelines typically have long-running\n",
    "processes that take significant time to complete. Which also means that the cost of failure\n",
    "is higher when errors are observed or flagged at the end of a process. Job-level runtime monitoring break up a job\n",
    "into a series of logical steps which are monitored for completion and time to completion. Monitoring the amount of data being processed\n",
    "through a data pipeline helps to assess if size of the workload could be slowing down\n",
    "a system. Another thing you can do to help you operate\n",
    "your systems at optimal levels is to run maintenance routines. Preventive maintenance routines generate data\n",
    "that we can use to identify systems and procedures responsible for faults and low availability. These routines can be: Time-based. That is, they could be planned as scheduled\n",
    "activities at pre-fixed time intervals. Or Condition-based, which means they are performed\n",
    "when there is a specific issue or when a decrease in performance has been noted or flagged. In this video, we learned about some of the\n",
    "aspects of performance tuning and troubleshooting for data pipelines and databases. We also learned about some of the monitoring\n",
    "and alerting systems and maintenance schedules."

    "Data Governance is a collection of principles,\n",

    "part of an organization's data management process—including the technologies, databases,\n",
    "and data models. What are the types of data these regulations\n",
    "seek to protect from misuse? Primarily, personal and sensitive data. That is data that can be traced back to an\n",

    "information. The General Data Protection Regulation, or\n",
    "GDPR, is a regulation specific to the European Union. It protects the personal data and privacy\n",
    "of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. In the United States, individual states have\n",
    "formulated their own regulations. For instance, California created the California\n",
    "Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, to better protect customer data. There are also industry-specific regulations\n",
    "that govern the collection and use of sensitive and personal data. For example, In Healthcare, HIPAA privacy rules govern\n",
    "the collection and disclosure of protected health information. In Retail, the PCI DSS standards govern credit\n",
    "card data. And In Finance, SOX regulations govern the handling\n",
    "and reporting of financial information. What is compliance? Compliance covers the processes and procedures\n",
    "through which an organization adheres to regulations and conducts its operations in a legal and\n",
    "ethical manner. Organizations need to establish controls and\n",
    "checks in order to comply with regulations. And maintain a verifiable audit trail that\n",
    "can establish their adherence to these regulations. Consequences of non-compliance with the standards\n",
    "can be severe. They can result in financial penalties, mar\n",
    "public perception, and result in loss of trust amongst clients and partners. It’s important to mention that compliance\n",
    "is not a one-time activity—it is an ongoing process requiring a blend of people, process,\n",
    "and technology that continues to evolve. Governance regulations require enterprises\n",
    "to know their purpose and be clear and transparent in their actions at every step of the data\n",
    "lifecycle. Let's understand this better by walking through\n",
    "a typical data lifecycle and just a few of the considerations that may apply at each\n",
    "stage. A typical data lifecycle in an organization\n",
    "includes the following stages In the Data Acquisition stage, you need to\n",
    "establish What data needs to be collected and the contracts\n",
    "and consent that give you a legal basis for procuring this data. The intended use of this data, published as\n",
    "a privacy policy and communicated internally and with individuals whose data is being collected. The amount of data you need to meet your defined\n",
    "purposes. For example, does the email address meet your\n",
    "purpose, or do you also need to have the phone numbers and pin codes? In the Data Processing stage, you will be\n",
    "required to establish The details of how you are going to process\n",
    "personal data. And your legal basis for the processing of\n",
    "personal data, such as a contract or consent. In the Data Storage stage, you will be required\n",
    "to establish Where the data will be stored, including specific\n",
    "measures that will be taken to prevent internal and external security breaches. In the Data Sharing stage, you will establish Which third-party vendors in your supply chain\n",
    "may have access to the data you are collecting. as well how will you hold them contractually\n",
    "accountable to the same regulations you are liable for. In the Data Retention and Disposal stages,\n",
    "you will be required to establish What policies and processes you will follow\n",
    "for the retention and deletion of personal data after a designated time. And how will you ensure that in the case of\n",
    "data deletion, it will be removed from all locations, including third-party systems? At each of these stages, you will be required\n",
    "to maintain an auditable trail of personal data acquisition, processing, storage, access,\n",
    "retention, and deletion. Now let's look at some of the controls made\n",
    "available through different tools and technologies for ensuring compliance to governance regulations. Authentication and Access Control Today's platforms offer layered authentication\n",
    "processes, such as a combination of passwords, tokens, and biometrics, to provide foolproof\n",
    "protection against unauthorized access of data. Authentication systems are designed to verify\n",
    "that you are who you say you are. Access control systems ensure that authorized\n",
    "users have access to resources, both systems and data, based on their user group and role. Databases, for example, have the concept of\n",
    "roles and privileges so only authorized users and applications can access specific objects,\n",
    "such as tables or rows or columns, in a database. Encryption and Data Masking Using encryption, data is converted to an\n",
    "encoded format that can only be legible once it is decrypted via a secure key. Encryption of data is available both for data at rest, as it resides in the storage\n",
    "systems, and data in transit, as it moves through browsers,\n",
    "services, applications, and storage systems. Data Masking provides anonymization of data\n",
    "for downstream processing and pseudonymization of data. Using Anonymization, the presentation layer\n",
    "is abstracted without changing the data in the database itself. For example, replacing characters with symbols\n",
    "when they are displayed on the screen. Pseudonymization of data is a de-identification\n",
    "process where personally identifiable information is replaced with artificial identifiers so\n",
    "that a data set cannot be traced back to an individual's identity—for example, replacing\n",
    "the name with a random value from the names dictionary. Hosting options in on-premise and cloud systems\n",
    "that comply with the requirements and restrictions for international data transfers. Monitoring and Alerting functionalities Security monitoring helps to proactively monitor,\n",
    "track, and react to security violations across infrastructure, applications, and platforms. Monitoring systems also provide detailed audit\n",
    "reports that track access and other operations on the data. Alerting functionalities flag security breaches\n",
    "as they occur so that immediate remedial actions can be triggered. The alerts are based on the severity and urgency\n",
    "level of the breach, which is pre-defined in the system. Data Erasure Data erasure is a software-based method of\n",
    "permanently clearing data from a system by overwriting. This is different from a simple deletion of\n",
    "data since deleted data can still be retrieved. In this video, we learned why data governance\n",
    "and compliance, which go hand-in-hand, are critical through the data lifecycle, and the\n",
    "role tools and technologies play in the governance implementation framework."

    "Automate metadata management and catalog data assets, making them easy to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trace data lineage to establish its credibility and for compliance and audit purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automate workflows and jobs in the data lifecycle to ensure data integrity, relevancy, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamline the workflow and processes to ensure data access and delivery needs can be met at optimal speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure a business-ready data pipeline that is always available for all data consumers and business stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a data-driven culture in the organization through automation, data quality, and governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data practitioner, using the methodology can help you reduce development time, cut wastages and duplication of effort, increase your productivity and throughput, and ensure that your actions produce the best possible quality of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "With DataOps, data professionals, consumers, and stakeholders can collaborate more effectively towards the shared goal of creating valuable insights for business. While implementing the methodology will require systemic change, time, and resources, but in the end, it makes data and analytics more efficient and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, it also opens up additional career opportunities for you as a data engineer. DataOps Engineers are technical professionals that focus on the development and deployment lifecycle rather than the product itself. And as you grow in experience, you can move into more specialist roles within DataOps, contributing to defining the data strategy, developing and deploying business processes, establishing performance metrics, and measuring performance.\n",
