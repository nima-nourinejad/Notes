    "Modules\n",
    "A module can be designed:\n",
    "\n",
    "To be imported (reusable code, like a toolbox).\n",
    "\n",
    "To act as an entry point (run directly to start the program).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a module is intended to be executed directly, it is often called a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every module automatically has some built-in attributes, one of which is __name__:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the module directly (e.g., python my_module.py), __name__ becomes \"__main__\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you import the module (e.g., import my_module), __name__ becomes the module’s name (filename without .py).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters:\n",
    "You can use this behavior to control code execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    # Code that should run only when this module is executed directly\n",
    "    start_application()\n",
    "This ensures the code inside doesn’t run automatically when the module is imported elsewhere.\n",

    "Classes\n",

    "        Python executes the entire top-level code in that module once (when it’s first imported into the current Python process).\n",
    "        \n",
    "        This includes all standalone code — anything not inside a function/class definition and not wrapped in a conditional like if __name__ == \"__main__\":.\n",
    "        \n",

    "\n",
    "Conditional execution based on __name__\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "Absolute vs. Relative Imports\n",

    "from ..utils import my_function  # go up one level, import a function directly\n",
